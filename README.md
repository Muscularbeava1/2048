How to Play 2048
2048 is a sliding puzzle game where the goal is to combine numbered tiles to create a tile with the value 2048. The game is played on a 4Ã—4 grid, and tiles slide in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.

Gameplay Rules:
Starting the Game

The grid starts with two tiles, each having a value of 2 or 4.
You can slide all tiles in one direction at a time (using arrow keys on a keyboard or swiping on mobile).
Combining Tiles

When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a new tile with double the value (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, etc.).
After each move, a new 2 or 4 tile appears randomly on the grid.
Winning the Game

The objective is to create a tile with 2048.
You can continue playing beyond 2048 to achieve a higher score.
Losing the Game

The game ends if the grid is full, and you can no longer make any valid moves.
